### Architectural Differentiators
- **Specialized controller per entity** - Clear separation of responsibilities
- **Automatic audit** - System that detects changes and logs automatically
- **Granular timeline** - Activities linked to general quotation OR specific insurer
- **Hybrid API** - Endpoints that respond JSON or redirect based on context

## 🔧 Key Implementation Highlights

### Business Logic Implementation
```php
// Dynamic insurer filtering based on broker-product relationships
$insurers = Insurer::whereHas('brokers', function($q) use ($brokerId) {
    $q->where('broker_id', $brokerId);
})
->whereHas('products', function($q) use ($productId) {
    $q->where('product_id', $productId);
})->get();
```

### Intelligent Audit System
```php
// Automatic change detection and logging
$changes = [];
if ($previousStatus !== $request->status) {
    $changes[] = "Status: {$previousStatus} → {$request->status}";
}
$description = "Update for {$quotationInsurer->insurer->name}";
if (!empty($changes)) {
    $description .= ': ' . implode(', ', $changes);
}
```

### Hybrid API Response
```php
// Supports both AJAX and traditional navigation
if ($request->expectsJson()) {
    return response()->json(['success' => true, 'data' => $data]);
}
return redirect()->route('quotations.show', $quotation->id);
```

*Project combining deep technical knowledge with real commercial application, demonstrating ability to deliver complete high-value solutions.*
